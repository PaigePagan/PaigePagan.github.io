This timeline shows how women's rights slowly began and evolved in Saudi Arabia, setting the standard for Muslim women's place in Islamic society. It's important for not only Saudi Arabian women to review thier history, but also Muslim women in general to witness what we have fought to achieve and envision the long road ahead to continue to fight for what we believe in. My inspiration for this timeline project was from [DW.com](http://www.dw.com/en/womens-rights-in-the-islamic-world/a-40714427) who did a similar timeline.
