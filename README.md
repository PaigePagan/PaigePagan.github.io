## The History and Progress of Women's Rights in the Islamic World 
<iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1f5UO5LsjbNBVpSHzhzxxKiEccPgLQvavOfKFb_yf7Zw&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='100%' height='650' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen frameborder='0'></iframe>
This timeline shows how women's rights slowly began and evolved in Saudi Arabia, setting the standard for Muslim women's place in Islamic society. It's important for not only Saudi Arabian women to review thier history, but also Muslim women in general to witness what we have fought to achieve and envision the long road ahead to continue to fight for what we believe in. My inspiration for this timeline project was from [DW.com](http://www.dw.com/en/womens-rights-in-the-islamic-world/a-40714427) who did a similar timeline.

The three colleges the graph focuses on is Arts & Sciences, Business, and Engineering. While all the percentages for each college have fluctuated, Arts & Sciences traditionally had the greatest number of undergraduate enrollment and as time progressed, more engineering students enrolled while enrollment in the business college continues to be the least amount.

## United States Civilian Labor Force By Sex
![Labor](https://github.com/PaigePagan/PaigePagan.github.io/blob/master/Labor%20.png?raw=true)
This line graph shows the difference of gender in the United States civilian labor force over the time span of 45 years. From 1970 we see a huge gap in the difference of gender in the work force. Women consisted of under 40% of workers, while men consisted of over 60%. As time progressed the graph shows the narrowing of the gap, working towards equality in the work force. However, the graph shows that even in 2015 there's still a gap where men reign supreme in the workforce, over 50%, while women are still below 50%. This is important to realize because while we have made progress as a nation towards equality in the workplace, we're still not at complete equality.

This map shows anti-mosque activity across the country within the past year. These incidents are only the ones that have been documented, there are plenty more incidents that haven't been reported and therefore haven't made it into the statistics. Also, numerous mosques have experienced multiple incidents of hate during the time-span of a year. The map shows that the nation hasn't progressed that much in terms of religious equality.

This interactive graph shows Summer olympic game gender statistics. It shows how many males versus females participate in each sport and how many medals either gender receives. The filter allows you to view the graph by gender and by medal. Overall, we can see that more males participate in what can be assumed as "masculine" sports while females are excluded entirely from many of the sports males play and are sometimes limited with "feminine" sports.
