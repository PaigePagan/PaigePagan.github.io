## The History and Progress of Women's Rights in the Islamic World

This timeline shows how women's rights slowly began and evolved in Saudi Arabia, setting the standard for Muslim women's place in Islamic society. It's important for not only Saudi Arabian women to review thier history, but also Muslim women in general to witness what we have fought to achieve and envision the long road ahead to continue to fight for what we believe in. My inspiration for this timeline project was from [DW.com](http://www.dw.com/en/womens-rights-in-the-islamic-world/a-40714427) who did a similar timeline.
## United States Civilian Labor Force By Sex
![Labor](https://github.com/PaigePagan/PaigePagan.github.io/blob/master/Labor%20.png?raw=true)
This line graph shows the difference of gender in the United States civilian labor force over the time span of 45 years. From 1970 we see a huge gap in the difference of gender in the work force. Women consisted of 38.1% of workers, while men consisted of 61.9%. As time progressed the graph shows the narrowing of the gap, working towards equality in the work force. However, the graph shows that even in 2015 there's still a gap where men reign supreme in the workforce, 53.2%, while women are at 46.8%. This is important to realize because while we have made progress as a nation towards equality in the workplace, we're still not at complete equality.

## Nationwide Anti-Mosque Activity of 2017

This map shows anti-mosque activity across the country within the past year, beginning from January 2017 and ending in December 2017. These incidents are only the ones that have been documented, there are plenty more incidents that haven't been reported and therefore haven't made it into the statistics. Also, numerous mosques have experienced multiple incidents of hate during the time-span of a year. The map shows that the nation hasn't progressed that much in terms of religious equality.

This data realization story shows different bias motivations for hate crimes that occurred in 2016. Each of the tabs are dedicated to showing the statistics surrounding one category of hate crime motivations. For example, the first tab is dedicated to hate crimes motivated by race, the following is based on religion, then sexual orientation, with gender identification following, and disability being the second to last tab. The last tab is interactive and is dedicated to showing all the different bias motivations together to compare and contrast motivations across all caterogires. I chose to focus on this topic because it went with my overall theme of inequality extremely well, and more importantly, it's imperative to expose the injustice that occurs in this country. Not surprisingly, the largest number of hate crime incidents were experienced by African-Americans. The next sequential bias motivations that experience the most hate crimes are Caucasians, Jews, and males. It's interesting that the two bias motivations who recieve the most hate are racial categories, followed by religion, then gender. The bias motivation that's targeted the least for hate crimes is Buddhists. My realizations can bring up many questions such as: Why is race targeted more than the other categories? Why are there more victims for hate crimes than known offenders? Is there something being done to stop this injustice? The last question specifically is the question I want viewers to get out of my realizations. Even though this data is from 2016, we can compare it to incidents that we're knowledgble about today and see that the same things happen. So what are we doing wrong or what are we ignoring entirely in order for injustices like these to persist? My hope is that I can spur action to stop these injustices. I'm aware that this is a big feat, but starting with the exposure is the first step. To view the story at its full size, click the "Full Screen" icon at the bottom all the way to the right. Browse through the tabs and get interactive with the last realization by clicking on the drop-down legend to highlight certain bias motivations.
